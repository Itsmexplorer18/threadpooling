# thread pool
a simple thread pool implementation in c++
## table of contents
# Introduction
Thread Pool in  is used to manage and efficiently resort to a group (or pool) of threads. Instead of creating threads again and again for each task and then later destroying them, what a thread pool does is it maintains a set of pre-created threads now these threads can be reused again to do many tasks concurrently. By using this approach we can minimize the overhead that costs us due to the creation and destruction of threads. This makes our application more efficient.
Disclaimer:This is a beginner-level implementation of a thread pool. There are likely more robust and safer implementations with better optimization and error handling.//# Build Instructions
## Code Walkthrough:
### main()
Initialization of ThreadPool(num) â†’ Test your system to determine the optimal number of threads for the best performance. The ideal value may vary depending on your system's hardware and workload.
### func()
This function represents the "work" assigned to a thread. In real-world scenarios, this could be any task depending on the use case. Here, it simply makes the thread sleep for a specific duration, simulating the time taken for task execution. In practical applications, this delay could represent computations, I/O operations, or other processing tasks.
